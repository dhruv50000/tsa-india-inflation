# Time Series Forecasting of India‚Äôs Month-over-Month Inflation

This project explores the behavior and forecasting of India‚Äôs monthly inflation rates from 1959 to 2022 using classical time series decomposition and multiple model-fitting techniques. It was completed as part of a university project with a team of 6 students from the Department of Statistics, Kirori Mal College (University of Delhi).

## üéØ Objectives

- Decompose inflation data into trend, seasonal, cyclical, and random components
- Test for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
- Fit various time series models (Simple Seasonal, SARIMA, ARIMA)
- Evaluate and compare models based on error metrics and predictive intervals
- Forecast future inflation values and identify macroeconomic patterns

## üîç Highlights of the Analysis

- **Data Period**: Monthly data from 1959 to 2022  
- **Decomposition**: Multiplicative time series model  
- **Stationarity**: Confirmed via ADF Test (p-value < 0.01)  
- **Cyclical Analysis**: Harmonic analysis used to detect oscillations (19th lambda significant)  
- **Model Comparison**:

| Model | Stationary R¬≤ | RMSE | MAE | BIC | Prediction Interval Width |
|-------|----------------|------|-----|-----|----------------------------|
| Simple Seasonal | 0.641 | 0.749 | 0.554 | -0.562 | 2.939 |
| SARIMA(0,0,2)(1,0,1)[12] | 0.378 | 0.767 | 0.560 | -0.488 | 3.650 |
| ARIMA(3,0,4) | 0.337 | 0.793 | 0.586 | -0.394 | 3.767 |

- **Best Fit**: Simple Seasonal model based on lowest RMSE and narrowest forecast interval  
- **Conclusion**: Data showed strong yearly seasonality and low trend over decades. Structural shocks (oil crisis, economic liberalization, demonetization, COVID-19) were visible in data movements.
